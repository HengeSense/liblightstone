title: liblightstone v1.0 released

liblightstone v1.0 has been released. This includes the addition of win32 support again, as well as more documentation. It isn't the end of the line for liblightstone work, as I'd like to add in more examples and some SWIG bindings, but it's certainly better than 0.9

I'll be uploading platform specific binaries soon, those will be announced as they're finished.
